I've been reading about mental models over the last month.
I look forward to writing more about them in the future.

I stumble upon [this](https://obedparla.com/code/a-visual-guide-to-react-mental-models/) article online and I immediately thought this article was great.
You must make your mental models, that will help you gain a more, deeper understanding of the content.

I feel this article takes a new approximation to React. It does aim to describe and generate knowledge and understanding about React, at least in a way I haven't seen before.

So that is the reason why I encourage you to read over it.

I think it is especially good for people who are new and lack more knowledge about React.
