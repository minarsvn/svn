It can always be quite frusterating and hard to generate a well sounding git messages. It depends on what you are commiting, but the commit can take a turn to the bad side.

Don't take me wrong, this is fun and sometimes you just express your feelings through your commit messages.

But that is not very describing. [Here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) is a way that does describe what kind of commit this is by using these pre-determined words: "fix", "chore", "wip", etc.

This can be helpful for collaboration work and easily recognizable.

In my opinion this is one of those thing that you don't have to do, but you will get better from it. You can improve your git knowledge and workflows. Tomorrow I will tell you about a git command that can also work well, especially with these kind of commit messages.
