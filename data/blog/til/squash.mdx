summary: 'Squashing your commits can help you keep your git history cleaner and who does not like clean history?'

Yesterday I mentioned Conventional Git Comments.
Today I present you with the Squash & Rebase command.

This can be a quite handy command. It can help you keep your git story clean.
I think it is highly valuable when you are branching off your master branch and then merging back to the master branch.

Let's take a short trip and look at this useful command.

`git rebase -i HEAD~N` where N is the number of commits you want to join, _starting from the most recent one_. Let's look at an example.

```bash
871adf OK, feature Z is fully implemented      --- newer commit
0c3317 Whoops, not yet...
87871a I'm ready!
643d0e Code cleanup
afb581 Fix this and that
4e9baa Cool implementation
d94e78 Prepare the workbench for feature Z
6394dc Feature Y                               --- older commit
```

And this is what we want to do:

```
871adf OK, feature Z is fully implemented      --- newer commit --┐
0c3317 Whoops, not yet...                                         |
87871a I'm ready!                                                 |
643d0e Code cleanup                                               |-- Join these into one
afb581 Fix this and that                                          |
4e9baa Cool implementation                                        |
d94e78 Prepare the workbench for feature Z     -------------------┘
6394dc Feature Y                               --- older commit
```

Obtaining:

```
84d1f8 Feature Z                               --- newer commit (result of rebase)
6394dc Feature Y                               --- older commit
```

You can easily select the hash of the commit just before the first one you want to rewrite from. So in this example, the command would be:

`git rebase --interactive 6934dc`

After this, you have to select what to do for each commit. But since this will only be a short introduction. I will recommend a few links where you can read more about rebase and squash.

This is a very useful command to better your git workflow. I recommend you try to rebase and squash your branches if you have a lot of commits containing small updates.
It is also good to squash commits to one before merging to your master branch. Since it will keep your master branch history cleaner.

A very good resource from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase)
[This](https://blog.carbonfive.com/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/) article was also helpful for me when I was using rebase.
