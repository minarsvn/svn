Everyone loves a dark mode, if you do not like it you just don't know you like it. ðŸ‘»

I stumbled upon [this](https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-design-delightful-dark-themes/) blog post and this is a high-quality post in my opinion.

Teresa goes over some good points regarding dark mode, for example avoiding pure black and pure white.

I also thought the part on reducing large blocks of bright color good information.

In all I recommend you to read this great article.
