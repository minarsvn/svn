Lets say you start making some new cool feature for your website when you suddenly remember that you forgot to make a new branch from the master branch.

Being the responsible developer that we try to be, we want to start making new features on a new branch so we keep the master branch history as clean as we can.

But now you have spent some time making thes new feature. If you have not yet committed to the master branch you can simply use this command

`git switch -c <new branch name>`

This command will use the [git switch]() command and take all of the unstaged work to the newlt created branch.

If you would've used `git switch <another branch>` where another branch is an alreadt existing branch you would get your unstaged changes on that branch.
