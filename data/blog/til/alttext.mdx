[Alt text on images](https://dev.to/arshadayvid/how-to-write-good-alt-text-for-your-images-1f78).

This is a well-informed article on a 'minor' thing, which I and probably others, do not take things like alt image text too seriously.

- Always use an Alt text.
- Don't use "image of" or "graphic of"
- Be Accurate

These are just a couple of things mentioned there and in my opinion, it is important to do these things correctly because they serve a very important role. Accessibility is something we should be more serious about.
