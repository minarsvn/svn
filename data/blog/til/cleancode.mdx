This is the first post in my 30-day challenge. ðŸ¥³

Some of you have heard or read Clean Code by Robert C. Martin.

Some people think that this is a must-read for every developer. It is not mine to say what you should read, but I'm quite sure that we can reach a similar conclusion that reading this book will not do you and your coding skills any harm.

A code that is more readable, reusable, and refoctarable is a big plus for everyone that has to work with it. Even though this everyone is just you. So by aiming to have a few WTF's as you can you are probably going to a good place regarding your code.

This book goes over a lot of things and here are dew chapters that we can find in the book.

- Meaningful Names
- Comments
- Functions
- Classes

And many more!

I stumbled upon this [github repo](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) which goes over the same concepts you find in the Clean Code book but in compliance with Javascript.

The book itself is written with examples in Java. So if you are not using Java that much the concepts can help you, but if you are doing most of your work in Javascript I recommend you to take a look at Ryan's repo. There you will get examples written in Javascript.

Like I mentioned before, I think everyone that codes could benefit a lot by using what is tough in this book.

This was the first post of many! Check again tomorrow for next one!
