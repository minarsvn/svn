I think there is no exact definition of what software architcecture is. But [this](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/3rs-of-software-architecture) repo does attempt to analyze three parts of software architecture.

- Readable
- Reausable
- Refactorable

Even though there are many different definitions on software architecture, I think we can all agree that these three parts are very important.

**Readability**
"Readability is the simplest way of assessing code quality and it's the most straightforward to fix. It is the most obvious thing you see right when you open up piece of code, and it generally consists of:

- Formatting
- Variable names
- Function names
- Amount of function arguments
- Funciton length
- Nesting levels
  "

**Reusability**
"Reusability is the sole reason you are able to read this code, communicate with strangers online, and even program at all. Reusability allows us to express new ideas with little pieces of the past."

**Refoctarability**
"Code that is refactorable is code that you can change without fear. It's code that you can deploy on a Friday night, and come back to on Monday morning without any concenr that your users encountered runtime errors."

Here we can see a short intro to each part. In this repo you cann dig deeper with code examples.

Ryan puts it well in his final thoughts:

"Software architecture is the stuff that's hard to change, so invest early in a readable, reusable, and refactorable foundation. It will be hard to get there later on. By following the 3 Rs, your users will thank you, your developers will thank you, and you will thank yourself."
