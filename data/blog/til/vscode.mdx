Since I started my full-time job as a developer I've increased my time spent in VS Code a lot ðŸ˜¬.

I know that there are more editors out there and they could well be as good as VS Code. I used VS Code in school so it's what I'm most used to, which is why I stuck with it.

Now after I spend more time on it I recognize that it does matter how you customize your editor to suit you.

Here is a site where you can buy content that could help you to make VS Code better for you by customizing everything you can think of! Keybindings, shortcuts, themes, zen mode, and more.

The number one thing I've noticed that makes my experience better is all of the different keyboard shortcuts you can make. They improve your efficiency and save you a lot of time.

[This](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/7-vs-code-productivity-hacks-17-extensions-that-will-change-your-life) was super helpful for me, some very good shortcuts and extensions.

[Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks) we also have great content on the editor itself.

I highly recommend to you to play around and condition yourself to use most of these keyboard shortcuts, it will be hard at first. But I think these shortcuts can improve your output and make the experience as a whole better.

I want to write a more detailed post soon about my development environment. So make sure to stick around ðŸ¤“
