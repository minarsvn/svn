You can never be too good at the fundimental things.
Here some good npm commands that I think you use often.

`npm i`
`i` stands for Install
this command installs all the packages mentioned in `package.json`

`npm install --production`
Install all the packages mentioned in `package.json`, except teh dev dependencies.

`npm i lodash`
Install a package, with name `lodash`.

`npm install --save-dev lodash`
Install the specific package as dev dependency, in this case the name is `lodash`.

`npm list`
List the versions and name of all dependencies in the current directory.

`npm update`
Update all the production packages in the current directory.

`npm install -g nodemon`
Install a package globally on your machine, with `-g` flag. In this case nodemon will be installed globally.

`npm remove lodash`
Uninstall/Remove a previously node module in the current directory

`npm -v`
Display the `npm` version installed on your system.

Again, this is just to refresh these good commands, you are never too good to skip the fundimentals.
