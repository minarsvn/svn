summary: 'What is new in React 18?'

React v17.0 was released in October last year.

[Here](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html) are some of the updates in React v18.

React Alpha has been published so that third-party library authors can try it and provide feedback.

React 18 will have some improvements like automatic batching, new APIs, and a new streaming server renderer.

The most interesting part about React 18 for me is that React 18. React 18 will have a new opt-in mechanism called "concurrent rendering" and it will let React prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same tie.

This can improve the performance of your app.

I recommend you to read more in the post above, the concurrent rendering looks very interesting.
