Recently me and my girlfriend bought a new digital camera so I wanted to do some research into photo editing software.
[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is an online version of photoshop, where you get almost everything that photoshop has but is free to the best of my knowledge.

I spent some time researching what editing software would suit me well. And I think photopea could be a fine place to start. Maybe I'll write a post in the future on what editing software I chose and why.
