summary: 'I want to get into habit of posting more on my blog, so I decided to challenge myself to post once a day for every day of June.'

I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) since the beginning of this year, I've been working towards building a second brain or a personal knowledge management system with Obsidian. I will publish a post about Obsidian in the future, but since I started using it I've been dumping a whole lot of content into my vault. A lot of the things I put in there are interesting, fun, or cool stuff I stumble upon anywhere on the internet.

So I'm going to publish one post about TIL (Today I Learned) or maybe it should be Today I Discovered for every day of June. It will perhaps happen that I will not be able to publish them on the correct day, but on the last day of June, I will have a total of 30 short posts about something I discovered each day of the month.

The content will probably lean towards technology, programming, and things like that. ðŸ¤–

I plan to follow this flood of posts by making an update to the site so I can have a certain tag on each post.

I'm also super excited to write about my experience using Obsidian.

So make sure to check in over the next 30 days, or so. To see what fun things I discover each day. This will not be long, just a short introduction and something more.
