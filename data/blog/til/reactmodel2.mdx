Yesterday I linked to an article about using mental models to deepen your understanding of react.
I liked that article, his mental model using boxes made me think differently about react and my understanding is now better.

Obed wrote a follow-up [post](https://obedparla.com/code/a-visual-guide-to-react-mental-models-part-2-use-state-use-effect-and-lifecycles/) where he builds upon his first mental models and uses them to make mental models regarding some well-known react concepts.

Those concepts are `useState`, `useEffect` and lifecycles.

I may sound like a broken record here... But I highly recommend you to read this article, I believe that it can improve your understanding of React.
