This is the last day I'll be posting these TIL themed post, but I think it is probably the most important one.

[Hanlons Razor](https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/) is a mental model that I think can improve our lives in such a big way.

I recommend reading the great article from fs.blog I mention above, but in short..

**Hanlon's Razore teaches us not to assume the worst intention in the actions of others. Understanding Hanlon's Razor helps us see the world in a more positive light, stop negative assumptions, and improve relationships.**

Let's say you call a friend, she doesn't answer. You try to call again few minutes later but still no answer, don't freak out and think that this friend doesn't want to talk to you.

Read the article above for better explaination, but remember, that like any mental model, Hanlon's razor has its limitations.
To make the best use of Hanlon's razor, we must be sure to put it in the correct context. Use logic and experience.
