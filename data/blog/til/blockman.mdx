summary: 'An interesting visual studio code extension'

I think [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leodevbro.blockman) extension can be helpful.

It works well for me, especially when you have files with more than 500 lines of code.
This extensions makes it easier to identify overview of code blocks and their scope.
