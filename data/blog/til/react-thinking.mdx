summary: 'A great part of the react docs. On how you can think in react.'

[This](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) part of the react documentation goes into details on how you can think in React.

I think that this way of thinking about react is very sensible.

This can help you think about how to construct your app and build your components.

I've found myself leaning towards thinking this way when building components.
I feel like it helps a lot to build a static UI after you've decided how to build components for your application.

For me this is a great way to keep the hierarchy of the app while still methodology building the application.
