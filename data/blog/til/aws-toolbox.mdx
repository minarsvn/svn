summary: 'DevOPs tools for AWS'
---

[Here](https://github.com/dannysteenman/aws-toolbox) you have a collection of DevOps tools for AWS.

For those who use AWS here you have a curated list of helpful tools.
The serverless world is always growing and I think it is very interesting.

You can find scripts, tools and other resources there, such as:

- Cloudwatch scripts
- S3 scripts
- Awesome CI
- Awesome ECS
- Infra as Code tools
- Lambda tools

This is also a good place to get to know the AWS serverless framework more.
