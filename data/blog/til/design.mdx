I know this can be quite a controversial discussion, but 'copying' other designs can be quite useful.
Of course you must continue to practice so you become better, but you can use some other ways to deploy good looking stuff while still practicing.

From [this](https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886) article:

"Every web developer inevitably runs into situations where they need to make visual design decisions, whether they like it or not."

It can be hard to make a well-designed website, especially if you have not gotten any practice or experience in designing.

So in the medium article mentioned above, you have well-thought-out steps on how you can make a design yourself.
Even though the original design may be from someone else.
